# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is a full-stack personal portfolio website designed to showcase professional skills, experience, and projects. The application is being migrated from a separate React frontend and Flask backend to a unified Replit fullstack architecture. The portfolio serves as a comprehensive professional showcase with interactive features including project galleries, experience timelines, blog sections, and contact capabilities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Testing approach: Always test and verify fixes work properly before reporting back. Do not come back without fixing issues completely.

## System Architecture

The application follows a decoupled frontend-backend architecture:

**Frontend (VisualPortfolio):**
- Single Page Application (SPA) built with React 18 and TypeScript
- Modern build tooling with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- Component-based architecture using Radix UI for consistent, accessible components

**Backend (VisualPortfolioServer):**
- RESTful API built with Python Flask
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database abstraction
- Modular structure with separate concerns for data validation, API documentation, and security

This separation allows for independent scaling, deployment flexibility, and clear separation of concerns between presentation and business logic.

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18 + TypeScript**: Provides type safety and modern React features
- **Vite**: Fast build tool optimizing development experience and production bundles
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, consistent styling
- **Radix UI**: Headless, accessible component primitives
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management with caching and synchronization
- **Wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing solution
- **Framer Motion**: Declarative animations and micro-interactions

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask**: Lightweight, flexible Python web framework
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM providing abstraction and migration capabilities
- **Marshmallow**: Schema validation and serialization
- **Flasgger**: Automatic API documentation generation
- **Flask-CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing configuration
- **Flask-Limiter**: Rate limiting for API protection

### Key Features Implemented
- Responsive design with dark/light theme support
- Project showcase with detailed descriptions and tech stacks
- Professional experience timeline
- Certifications and achievements display
- Blog section for technical writing
- Contact form functionality
- Downloadable resume access

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Frontend makes HTTP requests to Flask API endpoints
2. **API Processing**: Flask routes handle requests, validate data using Marshmallow schemas
3. **Database Operations**: SQLAlchemy ORM manages database interactions
4. **Response Handling**: TanStack Query manages caching and state synchronization on frontend
5. **UI Updates**: React components re-render based on data changes

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **Recharts**: Data visualization for charts/graphs
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Form handling and validation
- **Next Themes**: Theme management system

### Backend Dependencies
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM and migrations
- **Marshmallow**: Data validation and serialization
- **Flasgger**: API documentation generation
- **Flask ecosystem**: CORS, rate limiting, security extensions

## Deployment Strategy

**Database Strategy:**
- Development: SQLite for local development simplicity
- Production: PostgreSQL for scalability and production reliability

**Environment Separation:**
- Frontend can be deployed to static hosting (Vercel, Netlify)
- Backend can be deployed to cloud platforms (Heroku, Railway, AWS)
- Database migrations handled through SQLAlchemy

**Security Considerations:**
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- JWT authentication for protected endpoints
- Input validation through Marshmallow schemas

The architecture supports both monolithic deployment (single server) and distributed deployment (separate frontend/backend hosting) based on scaling needs.
